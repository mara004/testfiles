# testfiles

Various image and PDF examples for testing. All files are self-made and freely reusable.

The passwords for the encrypted PDF are:
* `test_user` (user password)
* `test_owner` (owner password)

(Note: The GitHub preview is not capable of PDF decryption and will report the encrypted file as invalid, although it is not)
